# Vitrine
Vitrine is a free software library that allows creating terminal applications
with graphical user interfaces. It's based on V's `term.ui` but it expands its
capabilities by offering a simple and extensible UI kit with primitives to
define the layout and contents of your application.

## Installation
```sh
vpm install Nirei.vitrine
